# SpinThatShit
A set of SCSS mixins for single element loaders and spinners 

[View examples](https://matejkustec.github.io/SpinThatShit/)

## Getting started


```
npm install spinthatshit
```
```
bower install SpinThatShit
```

OR

* Clone or download repo
* Include `src` folder to your project



## Usage

Create a div with your custom loader class name:

```html
<div class="your-loader"></div>
```

In your custom class name include a mixin of a loader. All loaders are ordered by number, so you will have to take a look in examples folder for your loader number.

```scss
.your-loader {
    @include loader01;
}
```

In `_variables.scss` there are default settings for loaders

```scss
$loader-color: #0052ec;
$loader-size: 56px;
$loader-height: 20px;
$loader-border-size: 8px;
$loader-gap: 12px;
$loader-animation-duration: 1s;
```

But you can also change these default settings, while your're including loader

```scss
@include loader09($size: 10px, $height: 48px, $gap: 8px, $duration: 1s, $align: middle);
```

All loaders can be also aligned to center, while including loader with parameter `$align`,
`$align: center` is just for x axis, `$align: middle` is for both axis.

**PARAMETERS**

Parameter | Type | Default value
------------ | ------------- | -------------
$size | Number | $loader-size
$height | Number | $loader-height
$border-size | Number | $loader-border-size
$color | Color | $loader-color
$duration | Time | $loader-animation-duration
$gap | Number | $loader-gap
$align | Keyword | null

**NOTE**: Some loaders may not need `$height` and `$gap` parameters.

## Performance issues

Some loaders which are using `box-shadow` for animation may be causing high cpu usage and lag, I'll need to look into more details and fix it, if it's possible.

If you have some new idea for loader/spinner or you want to fix loader just let me know.
